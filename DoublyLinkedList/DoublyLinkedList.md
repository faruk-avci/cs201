# Doubly Linked List

## Overview
This project implements a Doubly Linked List data structure in C++. It provides various functionalities such as inserting, deleting, printing, and manipulating nodes in the list. The doubly linked list allows traversal in both directions (forward and backward), making it more flexible than a singly linked list.

**Course**: Ozyegin University CS201 (Introduction to Data Structures and Algorithms with C++ and Java)
**Instructor**: Olcay Taner Yıldız

## Features

- **Insertion**: Add nodes to the front, back, or middle of the list.
- **Deletion**: Remove nodes from the front, back, or a specific position in the list.
